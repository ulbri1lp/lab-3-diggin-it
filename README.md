Answers to Lab 3 DNS Questions

1) So I am using the command 'resolve-dnsname' since dig does not work on Windows, however the output I get is very similar! It basically says where the server is located, and includes the type of record and IP address of the server our domain is running on! For umich.edu, there are two IPv6 addresses and two IPv4 addresses (designated by AAAA or A).

2) Test file is uploaded in the repository!

3) I don't think this really applies to the 'resolve-dnsname' command, however if you were using dig the command would be 'dig +short'
